# accessease_test_2
This is a test for the user interface
Hopefully this works and is useful.
You may need to install some npm/yarn packages in order for this to work.
These may include react native vector icons. The program should work, but incorrect items may be shown if the package is not installed properly.

Also of note. The folder structure of this is different than the default one, this is because the main programming that I have done is in the screens folder. Please add screens to that folder when programming.
