# accessease_test_2
This is a test for the user interface
Hopefully this works and is useful.
You may need to install some npm/yarn packages in order for this to work.
These may include react native vector icons. The program should work, but incorrect items may be shown if the package is not installed properly.

Also of note. The folder structure of this is different than the default one, this is because the main programming that I have done is in the screens folder. Please add screens to that folder when programming.

Another thing to note is how to get it working with webstorm.
Go to VCS/ Get from Version Control, Then select the correct project, in this case, AccessorEaze-UI. It should automatically create a file / folder for storing the file locally.

To test if is works, make a comment to a file. After that, commit the file to git, THEN push the local file to github.

I also think its important to note that if you havent updated the project in a while, it may be worth updating your local code so you always have the latest code just in case someone has updated it already.
